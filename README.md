# Dotfiles
Eventually, I do want to swap my dotfiles for a Nix-based setup, but for now, I've opted for the simplest solution: copying and storing my config files.

Here I have:
- Gnome Shell extensions
- Gnome Shell and icon themes
- Fish shell configuation (Gnome & OS X variations)
- Starship shell prompt configuration
- GCHi prompt
- Images (desktop wallpapers, mostly)

Please note that my Emacs configuration is not part of this package. It can be found separately, at https://github.com/SophieBosio/.emacs.d.
